# Chaos Game

This Python script generates a fractal known as the Chaos Game using the matplotlib library. The Chaos Game is a simple mathematical game that creates intricate patterns through iterative processes.

## Overview

The Chaos Game is played on a polygon with at least 3 vertices. At each iteration, a point is randomly chosen inside the polygon. Then, one of the vertices is randomly chosen. The midpoint between the current point and the chosen vertex becomes the new current point. This process is repeated for a large number of iterations, resulting in a fractal pattern.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib library

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    https://github.com/r98kh/Sierpinski-Triangle.git

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
    cd Sierpinski-Triangle

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    python3 -m venv venv
   
    source venv/bin/activate

5. Install the required libraries:
    pip install matplotlib

6. Run the Python script:
    python main.py
